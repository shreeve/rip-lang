# Rip Language

Rip is a modern reactive language that compiles to ES2022 JavaScript.

When working with `.rip` files, read `docs/RIP-LANG.md` for
complete syntax reference, operators, and patterns.

For compiler internals and project structure, read `AGENT.md` at the repo root.

## Key Syntax Notes

### Heredoc Whitespace Stripping

Heredocs (`'''` and `"""`) use the closing delimiter's column position as the
left margin. That amount of leading whitespace is stripped from every content
line. This lets you keep heredocs indented in your code while controlling the
output format precisely:

```coffee
# Closing """ aligns with content → fully left-aligned output
msg = """
  Hello, #{name}!
  Welcome to Rip.
  """
# Result: "Hello, World!\nWelcome to Rip."
```

Use `"""` for interpolated strings, `'''` for literal strings.

### The `?` Operator

The single `?` in Rip is used for two things only:

- **Postfix existence check**: `x?` compiles to `(x != null)`
- **Ternary conditional**: `x ? y : z` compiles to `(x ? y : z)`

CoffeeScript's binary existential `x ? y` (fallback if null/undefined) has been
**removed**. Use JavaScript's `??` nullish coalescing operator instead:
`x ?? y`. This eliminates the ambiguity between `x ? y` (existential) and
`x ? y : z` (ternary).
