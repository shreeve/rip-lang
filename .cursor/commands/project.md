description: Load Rip project context

You are working on **Rip**, a modern reactive language that compiles to ES2022 JavaScript. The project lives at `/Users/shreeve/Data/Code/rip-lang`. Before doing anything, read these files to understand the language and codebase:

1. **`AGENT.md`** — AI guide to the compiler architecture, project structure, build commands, testing
2. **`README.md`** — Language overview, features, operators, installation
3. **`docs/RIP-LANG.md`** — Full language reference (syntax, operators, reactivity, modules)
4. **`src/grammar/README.md`** — How Solar and Lunar work (this is the current project)

For packages work, also read `packages/README.md` for package overview.

Key references:
- `docs/RIP-LANG.md` — Language reference
- `docs/RIP-INTERNALS.md` — Compiler internals & design rationale
