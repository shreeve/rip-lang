        h3 "The Idea"
        p "Traditional frameworks build and bundle on the server, then ship static artifacts. Rip UI ships the 40KB compiler to the browser instead. Components arrive as .rip source files, are compiled on demand, and render with fine-grained reactivity. No build step, no bundler, no configuration files."

      .card
        h3 "Two Keywords"
        p "The component model adds exactly two keywords to the Rip language: component and render. Everything else — reactive state (:=), computed values (~=), effects (~>), methods, lifecycle hooks — is standard Rip syntax that already exists."

      .card
        h3 "Architecture"
        p "The Virtual File System stores page components in memory. The Router maps URLs to VFS paths using file-based conventions (like Next.js). When you navigate, the Renderer compiles the matching .rip file and mounts the resulting component. Each reactive binding creates a direct DOM effect — no virtual DOM diffing."
